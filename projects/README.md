## Project topics

Two project topics are available:
* [Bitcoin mining project](pow)
* [Selfish mining project](selfish)

If you want to do a different project or change parts of your project, please talk to me, I'm happy to help on that.

## Groups

The project should be done in groups of 2.
By September 29th please tell me by email who is in your group and what project you plan to work on.

If you have good reasons to work alone, talk to me about that.

## Presentation
All groups are expected to present their project to the class on Tuesday 13th October during lab hours.
This will happen on zoom.
The goal for the presentation is not to create a competition, but rather to learn from each other.

## Collaboration
Each group needs to write their own code and report. However, talking to each other is of cause encouraged.

## Report
You need to hand in a report for your project. 
Code should be published on github.
The report should explain some background and show and explain your results.
You can also explain what you may add to your project, if you had more time.
The report should not exceed 10 pages latex article.
Alternative you could also hand in a jupyther notebook.

## Grading
The project will be graded based on the report.
Of cause, it will be beneficial if you complete all tasks in the project.
However, more important than completeness is to you show that you understand the project, assumptions and results.
